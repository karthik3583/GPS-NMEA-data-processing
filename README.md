# GPS-NMEA-data-processing
Reception and Extraction of real time gps data using FASTRAX-IT600 Gps Receiver



Communication is a particular field in electronics which deals with transmission of data the information regarding the satellites which are present in space can communicate on GPS.Global positioning system determines the satellite information.But we require your position on earth.To get this, we need mainly three satellites for communication.These satellites give the information regarding their position in space

The global positioning system determines satellite information.Data from satellites is provided to the GPS.This GPS provides the data in NMEA format.NMEA means national marine electronics association.There are some particular formats in which data is provided.Extracting this information is the aim of this project.A specific format of data is selected, and writing c code obtains it in visual c. Now, this interfacing should be done by using RS-232, 9 -PIN CONENCTOR.HERE IN THIS CONNECTOR, WE USE ONLY 3 PINS OUT OF 9 I,.E TRANSMITTER PIN RECEIVER PIN AND GROUND.

Extracted data gives the information abut time, longitude, latitude, direction, altitude which determine the position on earth
